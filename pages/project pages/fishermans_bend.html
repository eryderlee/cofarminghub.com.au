                <h2 class="section-title">Fishermans Bend Digital Innovation Challenge</h2>
                <p>Fishermans Bend is Australia’s largest urban renewal project, covering approximately 480 hectares in the heart of Melbourne. By 2050, it will be a bustling precinct home to approximately 80,000 residents and 80,000 workers. The project provides an exciting opportunity to explore how data and emerging technologies can enable our city spaces to thrive now and in the future.</p>
                <p>The challenge involves presenting innovative ideas that can contribute to this vision. The winning idea will receive a reward of $90,000.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Our Idea</h2>
                <p>Co-Farming Hub has joined this challenge using the PWD SmartFarmAbility aquaponics farm. Our idea is to establish community aquaponics farms along the Yarra River and on community land around Fishermans Bend. These farms will be created using recycled materials, promoting sustainability and community engagement.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">About Fishermans Bend</h2>
                <p>Fishermans Bend is currently dominated by low-scale industrial and warehousing uses, but it will transform into vibrant, mixed-use, medium, and high-density neighborhoods. The project will significantly enhance the urban environment, making it a desirable place for living and working.</p>
                <p>The gentle curve of the Yarra River and the arrow-straight Williamstown Road are the human-made boundaries of Fishermans Bend. The area has a rich history, with diverse plant life and animals that supported Aboriginal people for thousands of years.</p>

                <ul class="steps">
                    <li>Flooding: Parts of the urban renewal area are vulnerable to inundation in tidal events, particularly within the Montague Precinct.</li>
                    <li>Land Contamination: Elements such as heavy metals and solvents may be widespread across Fishermans Bend due to its industrial past.</li>
                    <li>Groundwater Contamination: Elevated levels of nutrients, salts, and metals have been confirmed in the groundwater.</li>
                    <li>Geotechnical Conditions: Variable strength and quality of fill soils and potential differential settlement caused by the consolidation of Coode Island silt.</li>
                    <li>Water: Significant upgrades to the water supply infrastructure will be required if recycled water is not provided.</li>
                    <li>Sewerage: The existing sewerage system provides ample capacity to service Fishermans Bend, with potential for recycled water supply.</li>
                    <li>Energy: Adequate energy supply is available from existing infrastructure, but it must be maintained and protected from development impacts.</li>
                    <li>Transport: Upgrades to public transport, walking, and cycling networks are necessary to meet future population and employment needs.</li>
