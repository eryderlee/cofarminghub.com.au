                <h2 class="section-title">Our Approach</h2>
                <p>The Co-Farming Hub Franchise approach is based on piloting in Wyndham, where franchisees are trained and supported to run flexible home businesses using a central digital platform. They gain access to curated eco-friendly products, community greening services, and carbon-reduction tracking tools. The model promotes social and economic inclusion, job creation, and environmental sustainabilityâ€”all without requiring physical storefronts or heavy infrastructure.</p>

                <h3>Franchise Model Features</h3>
                <ul class="steps">
                    <li>Centralized eCommerce platform with full franchisee dashboards</li>
                    <li>Accessible online and face-to-face training & mentorship</li>
                    <li>Environmentally conscious product & service offerings</li>
                    <li>Low-cost, low-barrier startup model for disadvantaged groups</li>
                    <li>Integration with carbon-tracking & ESG frameworks</li>
                    <li>Built-in community engagement & partnership pathways</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Franchisees can develop income streams while contributing to broader environmental goals, such as local greening initiatives, urban regeneration, and carbon reduction. The model is highly scalable and designed to be replicable across multiple regions after the Wyndham pilot.</p>
